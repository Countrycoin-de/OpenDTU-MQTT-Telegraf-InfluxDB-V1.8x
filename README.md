# OpenDTU-MQTT-Telegraf-InfluxDB-V1.8x

Get OpenDTU topics from MQTT and imports them into InfluxDB V1.8x

This is a telegraf configuration, which collects data sent by an OpenDTU and imports it into an InfluxDB(Version 1.8x).
Because I didn't find a telegraf configuration for Influx V1.8x anywhere, I created my own.

As a template I have used the work of [smainz](https://github.com/smainz/OpenDTU-MQTT-Telegraf-influxdb-integration)

Furthermore here is a howto from [Kraego](https://github.com/Kraego/OpenDTU-Grafana-Howto/tree/main)

And finally the link to [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU)
